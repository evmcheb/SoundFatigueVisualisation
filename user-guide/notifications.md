# Notifications

In the notifications view users can see a list of the full notification history of the system, where notifications can be seen in the bottom image as list elements which show the notification type, room, time and peak.

Users are also able to edit the parameters which cause a notification to be triggered, namely the maximum allowable readings for volume (Decibals) and frequency (Hertz) before a notificaiton is triggered. The user enters new values into the two input boxes and selects a room for the limits to be placed on in the dropdown box on the right. Note that users cannot set a new maximum volume value without also setting a frequency value and vice-versa.
