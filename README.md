# What is SoundFatigueVisualisation?

Sound Fatigue Visualisation is a web app which allows users to gather meaningful data regarding the sound readings of an environment, in this case the sound readings on a ship.

The most common use case for this application would be for some sort of health professional or group manager to use this information in their scheduling of team members, as well as operation supervisors to use the application as another means to monitor the health of facilities.

The information the application displays is meaningful in that users can see information regarding the sound exposure different rooms and workers were, and are exposed to meaning important decisions can be made regarding workers' fatigue and overall health and safety, as well as possible malfunctions on the ship.

The available data to the users is as follows:

* LIVE decibal readings for each room in the facility
* Individual Room data including:
  * Decibal readings over given periods of time
  * Average decibal reading over the last 24 hours
  * Max decibal reading over the last 24 hours
  * Average & Max decibal readings over every hour of the last 24 hours
  * Pitch readings over a given time period
* Worker (Individual) data including:
  * Decibal readings over a given period of time
  * Max & Average decibal readings over the last 24 hours
  * Occurances of high decibal readings over the last 24 hours
  * Average & Max decibal readings for every hour over the last 24 hours
  * A dosimeter showing exposure compared to health & safety guidelines
* Notifications of sound occurances outside a decibal or frequency reading given by the user
* The ability to change the theme of the application for accessability reasons (Light, Dark themes)
