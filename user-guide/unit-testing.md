# Unit Testing

#### Front-end Testing

After installing all that's required in the Installation Guide, to simply run the test enter in terminal

`$ npm run test`

#### API Testing&#x20;

There is a test case for each API endpoint which are made to ensure the endpoints are delivering the required information in the expected format. Prior to running the tests make sure the requirements from `requirements.txt` have been installed. In the terminal run the following:

`$ pytest`

Once the tests have been executed there will be a notification informing what tests have succeeded and what tests have failed. If the tests have failed, the issues will need attention before proceeding with the use of the application to ensure the data is correctly displayed to the user.&#x20;
